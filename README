# Run the detection on the example:

./src/findVcfHetDeletions.pl $PWD example > out

# Run the detection on the ncl data:

./src/findVcfHetDeletions.pl $PWD ncl > out2

# Check for proper installation:

diff out expected.out
diff out2 ncl.out

# (there should be no differences)


# Exactly one of the samples in the data contain a known pathogenic heterozygous deletion:
#
# Gene	  Exon/intron	     Mutation	 rsID	 Alleles MAF	      chr	start	end (if different)	notes
# CLN3	  E12 	 c.954_(962+18)del27bp	 	   	 chr16	      28,493,656	28,493,630	pathogenic
#
# The deletion-containing Exon is covered by amplicon 'CLN3_Segment_5'
# Test to find the sample(s):

./src/findVcfHetDeletions.pl $PWD ncl |grep CLN3_Segment_5
